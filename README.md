📘 GCD Recursive Project

📖 Description

This project calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using a recursive method in C#. 

The program starts from the smaller of the two numbers and checks divisibility step by step until the largest common divisor is found.

🛠 Features


Input two integers from the user.


Recursive function to find the GCD using the simple divisor listing method.


Clear console messages for user interaction.


Output the GCD in a formatted way.


💻 How to Run

Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.

Copy the code into a .cs file.

Run the program.

Enter two integers when prompted.

The program will display the GCD of the two numbers.

🧮 Example

Code

Enter the first number: 12

Enter the second number: 30

GCD(12, 30) = 6
